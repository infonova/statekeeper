  "Evaluates event state changes.

  Takes a pred function to determine the key for the event stored
  inside the changed-stream-state.

  Optionally takes a map with the following properties:

  - :init   Expected initial state value (defaults to \"ok\")
  - :pairs? Receive the state of the previous event, in addition to the current event, as a vector. Defaults to false.

  Example:

    ```clojure
    (changed-state (str (:host event) (:service event)) {:init \"full\" :pairs? true})
    ```

  When the state changes emits a vector with the event and the previous
  state.

  seconds (default to 1 second), it passes on *all* events it remembers. When
  events expire, they are included in the emitted sequence of events *once*,
  and removed from the state table thereafter.
  Use coalesce to combine states that arrive at different times--for instance,
  to average the CPU use over several hosts.
  Every 10 seconds, print a sequence of events including all the events which
  share the same :foo and :bar attributes:
  (by [:foo :bar]

  The first parameter can be a number (dt value) or a map. The map keys are `dt` and `stream-name`. The `stream-name` value is used to keep the stream state between Riemann reloads.
